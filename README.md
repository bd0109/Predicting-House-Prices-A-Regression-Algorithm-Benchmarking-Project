# Predicting-House-Prices-A-Regression-Algorithm-Benchmarking-Project
The Predicting House Prices: A Regression Algorithm Benchmarking Project aims to analyze a housing dataset and predict house prices using linear regression and Bayesian ridge regression algorithms. This project involves benchmarking different regression algorithms to determine their performance in predicting house prices accurately.
## Project Description
The project focuses on analyzing a housing dataset and building regression models to predict house prices. The dataset contains various features such as the number of rooms, area, location, and other relevant factors that can influence house prices. By leveraging regression algorithms, the project aims to develop models that can accurately estimate house prices based on the available data.

Key tasks performed in this project include data preprocessing, splitting the data into training and testing sets, implementing linear regression and Bayesian ridge regression models, evaluating model performance using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE), and visualizing the relationships between the variables in the dataset.

The project showcases proficiency in data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization techniques. It also demonstrates the ability to implement and evaluate machine learning models for regression tasks, specifically in the domain of predicting house prices.
